            <p>When researching our latest customer-exclusive whitepaper, Branded Content, we interviewed over 30 premium publisher chief revenue officers and executives. We examined how they run, manage and sell their branded content programs.</p>
            <p>The first area we explored was pricing and packaging - and when it comes to
                rate cards for branded content their is certainly a feeling that it's a bit
                of the 'wild-west.' Publishers struggle with how to consistently price and
                package branded content programs.
            </p>
            <p>We first asked who's the buyer of branded content programs? The majority of
                publishers sell to combination of media agencies and brands directly.

            <p><b>Key findings:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Publisher sales teams are still more comfortable working with media
                    agencies.
                </li>
                <li>Brands still turn to agencies first as opposed to publishers for
                    executing content marketing.
                </li>
                <li>Brands are still very much experimenting with branded content and
                    require RFP support.
                </li>
                <li>Local and trade publishers rely mostly on brand-direct sales rather
                    than agencies.
                </li>
            </ul>

            As we continue to see the native marketplace expand, we are seeing new
            groups of professionals taking the lead on these programs. While we
            initially saw most of the buying coming from media agencies, we are
            increasingly seeing new groups of clients coming from PR, communications,
            and in-house newsroom. -Pete Spande, Chief Revenue Officer, Business

            <p>Next we asked, how do you price your branded content packages?</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5548d696e4b023a9adf9f85e/t/575af99520c647258a74bf57/1465579931158/?format=400w" />

            <p>Above image: Cost-per-view (CPV) is the fastest growing pricing scheme with
                almost 50 percent of publishers pricing branded content based on views.
            </p>
            <p>Most publishers currently offer a flexible pricing approach to branded
                content programs, with many providing a combination of alternatives. Today,
                57 percent of publishers still offer CPM based pricing arrangement, which
                is most commonly used when dealing directly with media agencies.
            </p>
            <p>This is still a holdover from media agencies that are more comfortable with
                legacy digital advertising with budgets usually tied to impressions and
                reach.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;CPMs for native media have been the primary pricing model for us due to
                agency budgets [being] structured this way, although program success is
                most commonly measured as views to the promoted content.&quot; - Greg Giusti, VP
                of Ad Products and Operations, Seeking Alpha
            </p>
            <p>Polar's research predicts CPM-based pricing will likely be phased out in
                mature markets as content programs are increasingly measured on views and
                engagement with the branded content pages themselves in this era of brand
                recognition and social reach.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;As customers look to branded content for greater engagement, moving to a
                CPV model allows use to use social and other platforms to provide a more
                measurable experience,&quot; Liz Percy-Robb, Product Manager, Johnston Press.
            </p>
            <p><b>Rate Card Benchmarks</b></p>
            <p>Pricing tiers vary widely across publisher verticals such as consumer news,
                lifestyle, finance, and trade - just to name a few. Based on Polar's
                interviews, the following charts contain pricing rate cards for CPMs and
                CPVs (article and video views). Across all three, consumer news has the
                lowest pricing tiers, while trade and B2B publications command the highest
                price.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The CPM rates published in the chart generally represent turnkey costs,
                which include: content production costs, paid social distribution, display
                promotional costs, and of course, native promotional media. Content and
                video views (or CPV) of branded content have become the new currency for
                sponsored programs. Many consumer publishers provide clients with
                hard-guarantees or soft guidance when pricing based on views.
            </p>
            <p>As native advertising and branded content has matured - so too has pricing.
                Most of the CPM rates you see in the charts above are blended and don't
                truly account for many facets of a publisher's branded content program save
                for the actual inventory.
            </p>
            <p>Instead integral parts of a comprehensive branded content campaign are
                lumped in with the initial inventory or not accounted for at all. These
                elements include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Content production costs</li>
                <li> Paid social distribution</li>
                <li> Display media on branded content pages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Again, agencies prefer this method if only because that's how they have
                presented their costs to their clients in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>If you're not already pricing based on CPV then your client's are likely
                calculating anyway. Polar recommends publishers shift to CPV model, which
                more accurately reflects the engagement of branded content. Regardless of
                how it's distributed, it incorporates views on whichever platform the
                content lives and still provides clients with a more accurate metric.
            </p>
            <figure class="op-ad">
                <iframe src="http://web.polarmobile.com/pratik/fbiaads/2.html"
                    width="320"

                </iframe>
            </figure>
            <p>The data also begs the question: why are video views priced so much lower
                than other content views? The answer is supply and social platform such as
                Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram are the culprits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> They are battling it out amongst themselves and the publishing
                    industry to cement their place as they first destination for branded
                    videos.
                </li>
                <li> They flood the market with video inventory, driving down prices.</li>
                <li> They drive viewers away from content creators as they content is all
                    viewed offsite.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To achieve the breadth of execution which is expected of them, publishers
                need to utilize these social networks for the distribution of their video
                content - but would be wise to incorporate video into an all encompassing
                branded content strategy that keeps readers on their site or leads them to
                the brand's call-to-action, rather than relying on video alone.
